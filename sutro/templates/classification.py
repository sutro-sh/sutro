        A simple template style function to perform classification on the provided data with Sutro. The intention is that the implemented code should be very easy to extend further, while showing a basic structure for large-scale classification with Sutro.

        It uses structured outputs with a scratchpad field, enabling the model to reason step-by-step before providing the final classification.
        The method supports various input formats including lists, DataFrames (Polars or Pandas), file paths, and datasets.
        The method will wait for the classification job to complete before returning the results.

        Args:
            data (Union[List, pd.DataFrame, pl.DataFrame, str]): The data to classify. Each row should contain some text to classifiy that fits into one of the passed in labels.
            classes (Union[dict[str, str], list[str]]): The classification classes. Can be either:
                - A list of class names, ie ["Positive", "Negative", "Neutral"]
                - A dict mapping class labels to descriptions, ie {"Positive": "Expresses satisfaction...", ...}
                Providing descriptions can improve classification accuracy, especially for ambiguous or domain-specific categories.
            model (ModelOptions, optional): The LLM to use. Defaults to "gemma-3-12b-it"; a model chosen for its balance of performance and efficiency, that also retains competency across a broad number of different domains.
            job_priority (int, optional): The priority of the job. Defaults to 0.
            name (Union[str, List[str]], optional): A job name for experiment/metadata tracking purposes. Defaults to None.
            description (Union[str, List[str]], optional): A job description for experiment/metadata tracking purposes. Defaults to None.
            output_column (str, optional): The column name to store the classification results in if the input is a DataFrame. Defaults to "inference_result".
            column (Union[str, List[str]], optional): The column name to use for classification. Required if data is a DataFrame, file path, or dataset. If a list is supplied, it will concatenate the columns of the list into a single column, accepting separator strings.
            truncate_rows (bool, optional): If True, any rows that have a token count exceeding the context window length of the selected model will be truncated to the max length that will fit within the context window. Defaults to True.
            include_scratchpad (bool, optional): If True, includes the model's thinking scratchpad in the output. If False, only returns the final classification. Defaults to False.

        Returns:
            The completed classification results for the provided data. If include_scratchpad is True, returns both scratchpad and classification fields in JSON object. If False, returns only the classification as a string.

        ## Classes
    
        {formatted_classes}
    
        ## Instructions
    
        1. **Analyze the input carefully**: Read and understand the full context - identify key elements, themes, and characteristics
    
        2. **Consider each class**: For each possible class, evaluate how similar the input is to its typical characteristics
    
        3. **Provide your reasoning in the scratchpad**: Think through which class fits best and why
    
        4. **Provide output**: Give your final classification
    
        If needed, use the scratchpad field to work through steps 1-3, then provide your final answer in the classification field.
    
        ## Guidelines
    
        - Select exactly ONE class, even if multiple seem applicable (choose the best match)
        - If the input is ambiguous, choose the closest fit and explain your reasoning
        - Base your decision on the actual content, not assumptions or implications
        - Similar inputs should receive the same classification
    
        Respond using the structured format with scratchpad and classification fields."""
