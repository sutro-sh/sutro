Food-led → likely false unless decisive/other strong signals exist.\n3) Hours:\n   - Apply strict late-night criteria. Exactly 11:00 pm closings do not qualify. Weekend-only midnight is supporting only.\n4) Reviews:\n   - Look for multiple references highlighting cocktails/mixology, beer/wine programs, bartenders, bar vibes, or hookah more than food.\n6) Apply threshold:\n   - 1 decisive signal → true.
