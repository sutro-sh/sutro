The restaurant itself is beautifully set up, cozy, elegant, and perfect for either a romantic date night or a classy meeting with friends or colleagues. The soft lighting, warm tones, and relaxed atmosphere create a setting that feels both upscale and inviting. The ambiance alone sets the tone for what could be a five-star experience.\n\nLet’s talk about the food, absolutely amazing! Everything we ordered was delicious, but the star of the evening was the massive mozzarella sticks. Honestly, I’ve never seen mozzarella sticks that big and crispy on the outside, gooey and melty inside, full of flavor, and perfectly seasoned. If you go, please do yourself a favor and order those. They’re a must-have!\n\nWe also ordered pasta dishes, and again, the kitchen did not disappoint. I particularly loved the seafood pasta, perfectly cooked pasta, fresh seafood, and a savory sauce that wasn’t too heavy. The flavors were well-balanced and comforting. The rest of our table also enjoyed their meals, and everyone agreed that the food was excellent.\n\nUnfortunately, where the experience fell flat was in the service department. Our server seemed disengaged and didn’t come around very often. When I asked for cheese (because who eats pasta without cheese, right?), he returned a while later, stood at the edge of the table and just asked, “Does anyone want cheese?” as if he was offering it randomly, not because I specifically requested it. I raised my hand, of course, but it felt awkward and honestly a bit ridiculous. It’s not a huge thing on its own, but small moments like this can really affect how welcome and attended to a guest feels.\n\nIt’s a shame because the food and setting set the bar high, but the inattentive service lowered the overall experience. I wish I remembered the server’s name because I don’t like leaving negative comments without details, but unfortunately I don’t. That said, with so many top-tier restaurants in the Windermere area, service has to match the quality of the food in order to compete. People don’t just come out for great meals, they come out to feel cared for and enjoy the whole experience.\n\nWould I go back? Yes! for the food, absolutely. But I hope management takes a closer look at improving staff attentiveness and hospitality. It’s the missing piece to an otherwise wonderful place.

As others have mentioned, the service could be a little more attentive, but everyone working there is gracious and welcoming, and we received our entrees very quickly - little things, like offering to-go containers or refilling water, are nothing that can't be improved over time.\nThe egg rolls here are the best in the city by a mile. Period. My wife, very health-conscious, ordered the stir-fried noodles with chicken not knowing they were crispy, but they arrived light and airy; the vegetables are well seasoned and cooked perfectly; and the sauce is incredibly delicious without being too thick or heavy.\nThe dish that really sealed my love for this place, though, is the dry vermicelli bowl. It is huge, just like they make it in Westminster. It comes with generous helpings of delicious pork, pork belly, shrimp, a ton of fresh and pickled vegetables, and tasted almost exactly like the food I grew up eating. I agree with other reviewers that there is a definite increased use of sweet chili sauce compared to fish sauce (the most heavily used sauce in Vietnamese cooking), but the entrees here are still delicious.\n\nIt's hard to put into words exactly what a restaurant like Saigon's Corner means to me. Yes, the food is great, but for me, it means way more than that. Eating here, for at least a couple hours, made me feel like I was back in California, like I had never left. Cooking is such a huge part of our culture, and out here in the Midwest, it's almost synonymous. It's the reason I hope this business gets all the traffic and support it deserves.

Hands down my favorite bagel of all time!!! Service was welcoming and as a energy healer, I felt the love behind the business and the food. No negative review can take that away and chances are from my experience,  most of the time, that review is from a rival.

First of all, I want to make it clear that I do not own this establishment, I don’t know anyone who works there, and I do not get compensated to write this review in anyway. However, I am a well schooled and well traveled person who has eaten all over the world – and it doesn’t get any better than PIZZA VILLAGE! I did some research online to find a good place that was close to the tubing spot (Bucks County River Country) where my friends and I went tubing today. After we went tubing, we came to PIZZA VILLAGE. From the outside~one could easily mistake this place for just your average pizza joint on a strip mall. Oh! But you’d be SOOOOO wrong!\nWhere shall I begin? We were greeted by Stephanie behind the counter, and she was really nice and warm. Then the gentlemen that were making the pizzas were also really nice. We sat down and ordered off the menu. Stephanie made sure we all had a very nice glass of ice water with lemon as we perused the menus. We ordered two garden salads, zucchini sticks, fried calamari, an order of french fries, and a large cheese pan pizza. Stephanie brought us over to show us all the different types and styles of pizzas that they make, and they all looked delicious – yet we went with the pan pizza because it looked like a deep dish style, and it made all our mouths water. The salads were quite large and made with really nice Romain lettuce, all types of veggies, and let me just say that they use the best blue cheese dressing I think I’ve ever had. It had huge chunks of blue cheese in it, and I could’ve eaten it with a spoon. The salads both came with two piping hot croissant shaped dinner rolls which we all devoured because they were off the hook yum! The french fries were cooked deliciously perfect – crispy and light. They even serve the more expensive Heinz Ketchup which doesn’t have the high fructose corn syrup.  Nice touch, and much appreciated! The calamari was tender and delicious as was it’s accompanying marinara sauce.  Now for the pan pizza…omg! Crust was cooked so perfectly. I’m smiling as I write this just remembering how delicious it was! It was lightly crispy on the undercarriage bottom and yet chewy just the way you want it. The edges around the crust were so frickin’ delicious I couldn’t believe it. The cheese, the sauce, forgetaboutit! I made the comment to my friends that if we were in a five star very expensive restaurant with linen tablecloths and candlelight, and they served this food, we would be absolutely delighted, and yet here it was being served at this very, very reasonably priced down to earth spot. The entire time Stephanie was so attentive and helpful and kind~she is just amazing! So are the guys cooking! We all chatted and all I can tell you is this place is filled with skill and love~need I say more? Frankly, I can’t wait to go tubing again just to come back to PIZZA VILLAGE.  I want to try everything on the menu! I noticed a sign that said they serve fish and chips, and I can’t wait to try it – I’m sure it’s going to be delicious!

Both the El Cubano Sandwich and the Crispy Pulled Pork sandwich were dry, and the meat-to-bread ratio was lacking (not enough meat on a thick roll). The Salsa Roja served with the pulled pork was okay, but not zesty enough to flavor a dry, bready sandwich. Better as a dipping sauce. Two of the three who ordered burgers said they didn't taste good. My 11-year-old ate all of his, but the other two adults quit after a bite or two. The Maduros (fried sweet plantains) were chewy; I suspect that either they were made with yellow plantains not ripe enough, or green plantains. The shoestring potatoes served with some dishes are both small in quantity and a waste of time in terms of flavor and edibility. No one ate theirs. I tried one and understood why: they don't taste like anything. I guess we were supposed to add them to the sandwich for crunch, but why? There's already enough starch in the meal.\n\nThe ugly: One of our group asked for her burger well done but received a severely undercooked burger. She sent it back. The chef brought out another burger made \""smashed\"" and assured my friend that it was cooked enough. But the inside was raw, even I could see that. My friend again sent it back. She received a complimentary order of grits instead, which were quite nice. But when she got her check, she had been charged for 50% of a burger in addition to her other items.

I personally tried the ground beef and Tinga chicken street tacos, the Made to Order Guacamole, and a small bite of the Ceviche. My favorite part of the meal was the fresh guacamole. Not only could you tell it was fresh, but it was very well portioned and was more than enough for two people. We had no problems adding some to our tacos but still having some for the chips. I was largely unsatisfied by the tacos. The flavor of the tortilla overpowered everything else. The Tinga Chicken had virtually no flavor other than the tortilla, and although I could taste the ground beef, I couldn’t help but think I could make better at home with some taco bell seasoning. I think the tacos would significantly improve with less tortilla (or maybe fuse them together so there’s not so much in every bite?). I used the green sauce on my tacos and it was very delicious - so much so that I was able to finish the meal with minimal issues despite aforementioned complaints. If I order tacos, I don’t expect the sauce to carry the flavor. The ceviche was okay. It was cooked and tasted as described so I think it is only personal preference that I didn’t enjoy it.\n\nThe Service:\nOur server was kind and spoke slowly. This helped us not miss anything he was saying but I couldn’t help but wonder if he was tired, which would be understandable because we came right before closing. He was helpful in selecting from the menu, and our food came out promptly and just as we ordered.\n\nThe Atmosphere:\nIt was a nice setup, I enjoyed sitting at the high top tables which included a booth and a high seat. The music was a good volume, it was just loud enough that you couldn’t hear other tables but not too loud where you couldn’t hear the person you were sharing a meal with. We noticed to at one of the TV’s was casting from someone’s personal youtube and showed an execution from another country’s news channel.

We just walked out and I already have to leave a wordy review. Service was kind and accommodating. Kitchen staff wanted to know if we enjoyed everything as first-timers - which we did. But the food… That vegan poutine! Perfection! I’ve had poutine from Montreal to Toronto and this contends with the best of them. The gravy is light but fragrant and herby (rosemary, yum). I got it on the side because I usually don’t like mushroom, so I was nervous, lol. But I ended up pouring it all on. If you like a more ‘whole food’ or natural approach to your vegan dishes, this one is creative and hits the mark. The cashew cheese curds are honestly what sold me on choosing to come here. Bravo for going that route. It complements the dish exactly how it’s meant to: a creamy, cheesy bite, with no extra processed garbage or crazy/weird taste. And we love us some (micro)greens. They delivered on the extra crispy fries, too. Left feeling full with a “small”. Would definitely get this again! Especially if they opt for any future varieties on the cashew curds, like a smoky chipotle, or other fun vegan-friendly toppings like caramelized onion or bacon bits (which are usually just TVP). I’d love to see a couple extra vegan options since this one was so great, but this one alone is worth going back for. You’re doin’ it right!!

However, this last event that we held at Kravings was just okay and the treatment we received from manager David afterwards means we will not be coming back again.\n\nWe held my son’s baptism brunch here, and Louis with the manager in charge that day. When we came in he immediately recognized my family and was incredibly generous with his hosting. My guests enjoyed the food but we had several food items missing, particularly the lox from the brunch menu. This was disappointing because I have a few guests who only eat fish. Not to mention the steak, kabob etc was never brought out.\n\nI had 4 guests who came later than expected and they were not given the full service (several dishes not brought out, not offered drinks etc). It was like they wanted us to just leave, even thought our contract allowed us to have the room until 3pm.\n\nI worked with David- the other manager- on the contract, and initially he was great to work with. When I emailed him after the even stating we didn’t receive several items and that we had a guest who did not eat and should not be charged and wanted a partial refund, he became defensive and rude over email, stating he needed to “clarify” things for me that occurred, even though that had nothing to do with the missing items or being charged for one extra person or having 4 guests not get the full service.\n\nThere were a few other things that did not go well on this day, but the experience was still good for my guests overall. I am mostly appalled at this level of engagement with David. What used to be a place that held fond memories for my family, and was supposed to be a happy day for my firstborn child is now bitter because of the treatment we received.\n\nMy family and I will not be returning and I recommend you just go to Fogo de Chao for your event- it will cost the same and the food will be better.\n\nEDIT TO RESPOND TO OWNER: David, I don’t understand why you continue to make false claims about the event and what you assume you provided. You were contractually obligated to provide ALL the food you offered on the menu which we discussed on the phone and via text, and your team simply did not provide it. It should not be based on demand, I had instructed it to come out well before the event. If this were any other restaurant and we paid for something from the menu and did not receive it, we would not be charged for it. Simple as that. Additionally, I did not ask for any sort of accommodation except that you refunded the money for the four guests that did not receive the full service, and they themselves felt rushed and dissatisfied. You can try to be diplomatic on a public forum like google but your email responses to me were rude and disrespectful and tried to manipulate the facts of event when you were not even present. It was truly your email exchanges with me that colored this experience, nothing else.

For the wraps, the two sauces that come with it are SO GOOD. you get the crunch from the lettuce and the herbs, and you get the noodles, and then the sauce just makes everything come together.

I am really bummed that the food quality has declined so drastically since the Fresh Press relocated to @ The Green. I passed through  Portsmouth today and decided to eat at FP because of how much I used to love the food. We ordered a burrito bowl and an avocado salad. The burrito bowl was made with white rice, which is a change from the old location’s brown rice, and not-so-fresh looking ingredients. My boyfriend ate some of his bowl, but didn’t finish because it was not pleasant. None of the ingredients were fresh or tasty. The avocado salad’s lettuce was not fresh either. It was a yellowish-brown color. I took a couple of bites but it just didn’t taste right, from the dressing to the vegetables. I had asked to add chicken, but there was no chicken on my salad so I asked for it on the side. I was handed a cup of chicken sitting in a pool of oil. (See photo.) It smelled and tasted foul. We left quietly and tossed our food. It is now about a half hour later and we feel nauseated from the few bites of our food that we had. I really, really hope that this review serves as a wake-up call to the owner and/or management at Fresh Press. If not, I hope to at least caution future customers regarding the food quality.

The variety of sides continues with some amazing jalapeño poppers and many other things that we will have to try on our next visit.\nThe waffles and fried Oreos were imaculate as well.\n\nWhat really stands out is how the staff manages to make each visit feel special.
